Cloud infrastructure as a service
IAAS
    The capability provided to the consumer is to rent processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources.
        The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly select networking components (e.g., firewalls, load balancers).
        Examples: Amazon, RackSpace


Cloud Platform as a service
PAAS
    The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created applications using programming languages and tools supported by the provider (e.g., Java, Python, .Net). 
        The consumer only has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.
        Examples: Google AppEngine, Microsoft Azure


Cloud Software as a service
SAAS
    The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure and accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a Web browser.
        The consumer only has control over limited user-specific application configuration settings.
        Example: SalesForce
