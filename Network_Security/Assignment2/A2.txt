1  Lab – Network Scanning
1. Overview
• The objective of this assignment is to perform a ping sweeping and port scanning.
• This learning objective is evaluated by examining the outputs captured in screenshots after
performing the tasks.

2. Background
• Study Nmap using the following sites: http://nmap.org/
• To learn how to scan networks and ports, go to the following sites.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nmap-cheat-sheet

• To switch into a super user, type the following command: “sudo su”.

• Warning: You must not scan any live servers using Nmap or send malicious packets using
hping3. If caught, you may be indicted (not a joke!).

3. Preparation
• You will do this lab using Network Security Workspace on the CyberGym.

4. Tasks
Task 1. Identifying the IP address of Kali
• Find the IP address and the subnet mask of Kali (use ifconfig). Report the result with a screenshot.

Task 2. Ping Sweeping
• Perform a ping sweeping attack with Nmap by sending a series of ICMP echo request
packets to a range of IP addresses on a network.
• Pick the network address of the Kali machine and perform ping sweeping.
• For ping sweeping, you have to provide the “network address/CIDR notation of the subnet
mask.” (e.g., 192.168.10.0/24). Use -sP flag for ping sweeping. It takes a while and so be
patient.
• In general, this is the command we use for Ping Sweeping.
2
o $ nmap -sP x.x.x.0/24 , where x.x.x.0 is the IP address of the network. o
(Example) $ nmap -sP 192.168.10.0/24 , where x.x.x.0 is the IP address of the
network.
• Task
1) Report your result in a screenshot like below.


Task 3. Port Scanning
• Port scanning is an attempt to connect to a computer’s ports to see whether any ports are
active and listening.
• Scan the target (scanme.nmp.org) from your Kali and capture the packets with Wireshark on
Kali. The site scanme.nmap.org is set up by the Nmap Security Scanner Project and
insecure.org. This site helps learners test their Nmap installation or Internet connection. You
can legally scan this site with port scanning tools.
• Steps:
1) Start Wireshark on Kali after selecting the proper interface. To launch Wireshark, type
“wireshark” on the command shell.
2) Run the following command and wait until you get the result.
• Task
Answer the following questions. Provide a screenshot for each question to support your answer.
For the answers, use the display filter “tcp.stream eq xx” (replace xx with the integer) as
necessary.

3
1) Which type of TCP packet (e.g., SYN, SYN/ACK, or ACK) was sent from your Kali to the
victim?  SYN


2) Which type of TCP packet (e.g., SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK, or RST) was received from the
victim to the Kali in response?
ACK
