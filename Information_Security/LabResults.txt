Exercise 3: Devise a way to find out how long the buffer is before it starts to overflow. Answer
the following questions:

16 Characters

2. How did you figure out the required length before overflow?
under 12 seconds

3. What was the effect of the overflowed input field?
root privileges given to the user




Exercise 4: Discussion
1. What were the likely culprits in the buffer overflow?
   No validation of input length or denial response.

2. How should you design around these issues to make programs less susceptible to these
failures?
   Add validation of inputs, if prompting for a Password.

3. Describe a policy that you can put in place for software development to mitigate the
possibility of such issues making it into the final program code.
   Confirm validations for inputs is correct, and test them.
